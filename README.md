# Raspberry-Pi-irrigator
A Raspberry Pi controlled irrigation system to water plants based on soil moisture.

This project is ongoing and these are my notes...

## Components

* 2x Goso AB11 solenoid pumps (from eBay)[https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/12V-Dosing-Pump-Peristaltic-Head-For-Aquarium-Lab-Analytical-Water-Arduino-DIY/202050095537] in green and blue. The pumps run at 12V 7.5W. SO 7.5W÷12V=0.625A.
* 2x STM ULN2803A Darlington Drivers (from eBay)[https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/ULN2803A-Darlington-Driver-TRANSISTOR-ARRAY-8-NPN-x-2-pcs/222622920820]. The darlington driver has inbuilt rectifier diodes. 
* MCP3008 ADC (old)
* YL69 moisture sensor (old, from Kuman kit from Amazon). The YL-69 consists of an electrode and an amplifier (LM393) module. The YL69 oxidises over time, further down the line, I might need to switch the electrode to a pair of graphite cores of a pencil as suggested online —or 2mm mechanical pencil refills. LM393 is a comparator not a op-amp like a LM358. For project completion I would need multiple sensors. I'll decide once I try the YL-69.


Need. Croc clip for motor and more female to female cable!?!
